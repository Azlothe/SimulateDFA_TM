# Turing Machine simulate DFA
Turing Machine transducer that **takes in** an input and a string encoding of an Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) model and **outputs** what the DFA would. 
Models such as the DFA output an evaluation of an input as accept/reject, whereas transducers can output transformed input.
Our simulation will output "A" or "R" for accept or reject respectively.

SimulateDFA_TM.jff is the main Turing Machine specification file to be ran. Other jff files are editable intermediate building blocks.



Made in JFLAP. Run under "Turing Machine with Building Blocks" selection and with "Transducer mode"
